-- Update function looks like it's a keyword function. 
-- There's updateValue, updateColor, and updateText,this looks promising. 
-- Okay, I feel good about this. We should start prioritizing the most important stuff. 
	--	Control and report pressure
	--	Control and report brew and drain time

Implementation

--	We'll probably put a stepper for the pressure, brew, and drain time. 
--	We'll use text/labels instead of text fields, since changing them by texfield 


Bonus
--	It'd be cool if we can display the Prisma icon in the top left corner.
